# Ticket Filtering and Hydration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hydration Errors

- **Problem**: Browser extensions (like Grammarly) were adding attributes to HTML elements that didn't exist during server-side rendering
- **Solution**: Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<html>` and `<body>` tags in `app/layout.tsx`

### 2. Aggressive Ticket Filtering

- **Problem**: The `getUserTickets` functions were filtering out legitimate tickets due to overly restrictive filtering logic
- **Solution**: Relaxed filtering criteria to support both paid and free tickets

## Changes Made

### 1. `/app/layout.tsx`

```tsx
// Added suppressHydrationWarning to prevent browser extension conflicts
<html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
  <body suppressHydrationWarning>
```

### 2. `/convex/events.ts` - getUserTickets function

**Before**: Aggressive filtering that excluded:

- Tickets without `paystackReference`
- Tickets with `paystackReference === 'test'`
- Tickets with references containing `'test_ref_'` or `'test_protection_check'`

**After**: Relaxed filtering that only excludes:

- `paystackReference === 'TEST_ONLY_REFERENCE'`
- `paystackReference.startsWith('INTERNAL_TEST_')`
- `paystackReference === 'DEBUG_TEST_TICKET'`

### 3. `/convex/tickets.ts` - Multiple functions updated

- `getUserTicketForEvent` function
- `getUserTicketForEventOptimized` function
- Applied same relaxed filtering logic

### 4. `/app/tickets/page.tsx` - Enhanced UI

- Added recent purchase detection from localStorage
- Better error handling and debugging information
- Improved user experience with informative messages
- Added refresh functionality for users waiting for tickets to appear

## Benefits

1. **Supports Both Paid and Free Tickets**:

   - Paid tickets with PayStack references now display properly
   - Free tickets without PayStack references are also supported

2. **Fixes Hydration Errors**:

   - Browser extension conflicts resolved
   - No more React hydration mismatch warnings

3. **Better User Experience**:

   - Users see helpful messages when tickets are processing
   - Debug information available for troubleshooting
   - Recent purchase detection helps users understand processing delays

4. **Maintains Security**:
   - Still filters out obvious test tickets
   - Only excludes very specific test patterns to avoid false positives

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Paid Tickets**: Purchase a ticket and verify it appears in /tickets
2. **Test Free Tickets**: Create a free event and verify free tickets display
3. **Test Recent Purchase Flow**: Complete a payment and check for proper messaging
4. **Test Hydration**: Check that no hydration warnings appear in browser console
5. **Test Different Browsers**: Verify functionality with/without browser extensions

## Monitoring

- Check server logs for `[OPTIMIZED]` and `[FILTER]` messages
- Monitor ticket display rates after purchases
- Watch for any remaining hydration warnings in production
