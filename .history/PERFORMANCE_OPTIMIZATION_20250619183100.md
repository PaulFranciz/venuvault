# Performance Optimization Plan for Event-Pulse

## Current Status: 50-100 Concurrent Users

**Target: 1,000-2,000 Concurrent Users**

## üîç Identified Bottlenecks (From Load Testing)

### 1. User Tickets API - CRITICAL BOTTLENECK

- **Current**: 1.8-2.0 seconds response time
- **Target**: <300ms
- **Issue**: No caching, direct Convex calls for each request

### 2. Queue Position API - MODERATE BOTTLENECK

- **Current**: 200ms-1.3s response time
- **Target**: <100ms
- **Issue**: Connection limiting too aggressive, cache misses

### 3. Redis Connection Management - INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE

- **Issue**: Multiple connection creation, no proper pooling
- **Impact**: Connection overhead, potential timeouts

## üöÄ Required Optimizations (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Critical Performance Fixes (Week 1)

#### A. User Tickets API Optimization

```typescript
// Current bottleneck - needs aggressive caching
app/api/users/[id]/tickets/route.ts
- Implement 5-minute cache for user tickets
- Add Redis-based user session caching
- Batch Convex queries where possible
```

#### B. Convex Query Optimization

```typescript
// Batch queries to reduce API calls
- Implement query batching for user data
- Add Convex edge caching
- Use Convex subscriptions for real-time updates instead of polling
```

#### C. Redis Connection Pooling

```typescript
// Fix connection management
lib/redis.ts
- Implement proper connection pooling (max 50 connections)
- Add connection health monitoring
- Implement Redis cluster support for high availability
```

### Phase 2: Scalability Improvements (Week 2)

#### A. Database Query Optimization

```sql
-- Add proper indexes for common queries
- User tickets by event_id and user_id
- Queue positions by event_id
- Event availability queries
```

#### B. API Response Optimization

```typescript
// Reduce payload sizes
- Implement field selection for API responses
- Add response compression (gzip)
- Implement GraphQL-style query optimization
```

#### C. Caching Strategy Enhancement

```typescript
// Multi-layer caching
- L1: In-memory cache (Node.js process)
- L2: Redis cache (shared)
- L3: CDN cache (static content)
```

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Scaling (Week 3)

#### A. Horizontal Scaling

```yaml
# Vercel/Infrastructure
- Enable auto-scaling based on CPU/memory
- Implement load balancing
- Add multiple Redis instances
```

#### B. Queue System Optimization

```typescript
// BullMQ improvements
- Increase worker concurrency (currently 10)
- Add queue prioritization
- Implement job batching
```

#### C. Monitoring & Alerting

```typescript
// Performance monitoring
- Add APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- Implement real-time error tracking
- Add capacity planning metrics
```

## üìà Expected Performance Improvements

### After Phase 1 (Week 1):

- **Capacity**: 200-400 concurrent users
- **User Tickets API**: <500ms (from 2000ms)
- **Queue Position API**: <200ms (from 1300ms)
- **Error Rate**: <1% (from 3%)

### After Phase 2 (Week 2):

- **Capacity**: 500-800 concurrent users
- **Overall API Response**: <300ms average
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >80%
- **Database Load**: 50% reduction

### After Phase 3 (Week 3):

- **Capacity**: 1,000-2,000 concurrent users
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scale to 10+ instances
- **99.9% Uptime**: With proper monitoring
- **Sub-second Response Times**: For all APIs

## üõ† Implementation Commands

### Immediate Actions (Today):

```bash
# 1. Optimize User Tickets API
npm run optimize:user-tickets

# 2. Fix Redis Connection Pooling

```

### Week 1 Milestones:

- [ ] User Tickets API under 500ms
- [ ] Redis connection pooling implemented
- [ ] Aggressive caching for all APIs
- [ ] Load test passing at 200 concurrent users

### Week 2 Milestones:

- [ ] Database query optimization complete
- [ ] Multi-layer caching implemented
- [ ] API payload optimization
- [ ] Load test passing at 500 concurrent users

### Week 3 Milestones:

- [ ] Horizontal scaling configured

- [ ] Queue system optimization
- [ ] Load test passing at 1,000+ concurrent users

## üö® Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Immediate Attention):

1. **User Tickets API** - Currently 10x slower than acceptable
2. **Redis Connection Management** - Can cause cascading failures
3. **No Proper Monitoring** - Can't detect issues before they become critical

### Medium Risk:

1. **Queue System Bottlenecks** - May limit ticket purchasing
2. **Database Query Performance** - Will degrade under load
3. **Lack of Auto-scaling** - Manual intervention required

### Low Risk:

1. **CDN Optimization** - Nice to have but not critical
2. **Advanced Caching Strategies** - Incremental improvements

## üí∞ Cost Implications

### Current Infrastructure Cost: ~$100/month

- Vercel Pro: $20/month
- Convex: $25/month
- Redis (Upstash): $25/month
- Monitoring: $30/month

### Optimized Infrastructure Cost: ~$300-500/month

- Vercel Pro with scaling: $100-200/month
- Convex with higher limits: $100/month
- Redis Cluster: $100/month
- Advanced monitoring: $50/month
- CDN optimization: $50/month

### ROI Analysis:

- **Current**: 50-100 users = $1-2 per user per month
- **Optimized**: 1,000-2,000 users = $0.15-0.50 per user per month
- **Break-even**: At 200+ concurrent users, optimization pays for itself
